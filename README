 h5mma
===============================================================================
 Version 0.1
 Copyright 2011 Barry Wardell and Ian Hinder

The h5mma package provides improved support for reading HDF5 files in
Mathematica. It is significantly faster, more memory efficient and crash
resilient than the built-in HDF5 reading support.
===============================================================================


Getting the package
-------------------
Binary versions of the h5mma package can be downloaded from the project
webpage:

http://sourceforge.net/p/h5mma

The latest development version will always be available from the project git
repository:

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/h5mma/code h5mma


Requirements
------------
Mathematica: h5mma requires Mathematica version 6 or newer. It may be possible
  to get it to work with older versions, but this is not supported.

HDF5: A version of the HDF5 library providing the version 1.8 API is required
  to build from source. Binary versions of the package already include HDF5.


Installation
------------
Mac OSX 10.6 (Binary):
Double-click the dmg fie. Drag the h5mma folder to "Mathematica Applications".
This will install h5mma in /Library/Mathematica/Applications.

Mac OSX (MacPorts):
sudo port install hdf5-18
make && make install

Mac OSX (Fink):
sudo apt-get install hdf5-18 szip
make && make install

Other:
Create the file 'make.defs' using the template provided in 'make.defs.example'.
Edit the paths in this file to point to the appropriate locations on your
machine:

HDF5DIR:    This should be the directory containing lib/libhdf5*.
MLINKDIR:   This should be the directory containing mcc and mprep.
INSTALLDIR: This is optional and can be used to override the directory where
            h5mma will be installed. Sensible defaults are chosen on Linux
            (${HOME}/.Mathematica/Applications/h5mma) and Mac OSX
            (${HOME}/Library/Mathematica/Applications/h5mma) so this will not
            normally need to be set.

Once these paths have been set, build and install h5mma:
make && make install

Usage
-----
The package may then be loaded into Mathematica using the command:

<< h5mma`

The main command provided is ImportHDF5, which mimics the behavior of Import.


Examples
--------
For example usage, see the h5mma.nb Mathematica notebook in the doc directory.
