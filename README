 h5mma
===============================================================================
 Version 1.1.0
 Copyright 2011-2013 Barry Wardell and Ian Hinder

The h5mma package provides improved support for reading HDF5 files in
Mathematica. It is significantly faster, more memory efficient and crash
resilient than the built-in HDF5 reading support.
===============================================================================


Getting the package
-------------------
Binary versions of the h5mma package can be downloaded from the project
webpage:

http://bitbucket.org/simulationtools/h5mma

The source is available from the project git repository:

git clone https://bitbucket.org/simulationtools/h5mma


Requirements
------------
Mathematica: h5mma requires Mathematica version 6 or newer. It may be possible
  to get it to work with older versions, but this is not supported.

HDF5: A version of the HDF5 library providing the version 1.8 API is required
  to build from source. Binary versions of the package already include HDF5.


Installation
------------
The most straightforward way to install h5mma is using the binary packages
provided at

http://bitbucket.org/simulationtools/h5mma/downloads

Once you have downloaded a binary package, extract it into the Mathematica
Applications directory. To find the correct location of this directory on
your system, run the following command in Mathematica:

  FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]


Usage
-----
The package may be loaded into Mathematica using the command:

<< h5mma`

The main command provided is ImportHDF5, which mimics the behavior of Import.


Examples
--------
For example usage, see the h5mma.nb Mathematica notebook in the doc directory.


Compiling
---------

It should normally not be necessary to compile h5mma yourself. If you find you
do need to do so, instructions can be found on the project wiki at
http://bitbucket.org/simulationtools/h5mma/wiki


Known problems
--------------
Known bugs are recorded in the project bug tracker:
